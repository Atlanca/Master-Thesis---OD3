<!-- {{question: How is the feature {main_entity} mapped to its implementation?}} -->

<p>
The functionality of feature {main_entity} can be decomposed into {nbr_requirements} requirements. They are realized 
by the architecture which in turn is implemented by {nbr_implementation} implementation classes in the source code.  
</p>

<p>
The subsequent sections contain descriptions of the most significant entities found in this explanation, 
namely the feature, the requirements and the implementation classes {main_entity}.

<p>
The left-side panel illustates the requirements to {main_entity} and the implementation classes related to them. 
This is an overview of the mapping between Purchase products and the source code.
