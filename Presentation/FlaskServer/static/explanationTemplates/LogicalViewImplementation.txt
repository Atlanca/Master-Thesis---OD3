<!-- {{question: How is the feature {main_entity} mapped to its implementation?}}
 -->

<p>
The feature {main_entity} {rel_feat_req} {nbr_req} functional requirements which are {rel_req_logic} {nbr_logic} 
logical classes in the logical view of the architecture. These classes are in turn {rel_logic_dev} classes and 
class packages in the development view of the architecture. The development classes are finally 
{rel_dev_impl} the source code.

<p>
The left-side panel demonstrates how the feature {main_entity} maps to the implementation 
classes via the Logical view. Clicking on any entity will highlight the paths to its other related entities. 
To see all available actions, click the round "i" button at the top left of the panel.

<p>
The subsequent sections contain descriptions of the most significant entities found in this explanation, 
namely the logical classes, the requirements and the feature {main_entity}.
