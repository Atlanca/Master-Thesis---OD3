<!-- {{question: How are the implementation classes given in the answer for the orginal question mapped to the Architectural patterns?}} -->
<!-- {{original question: How is the feature {main_entity} mapped to its implementation?}} -->

<p>
This view shows how the implementation classes that are related to the feature {main_entity} are related to the architectural patterns. 
The {nbr_impl} implementation classes are related to a total of {nbr_dev} development entities. The development entities together play {nbr_role} 
different roles. 
The roles are finally part of {nbr_arch_patt} architectural patterns. 
</p>

<p>
The subsequent sections contain descriptions of the most significant entities found in this explanation, 
namely the implementation classes, the development entities, the pattern roles and the architectural patterns {main_entity}.

<p>
The panel to the left illustrates the structural paths from the implementation classes to the architectural patterns.
